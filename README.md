## About Fatalii
Fatalii makes BDD accessible to anyone who wants to create end-to-end tests but is not comfortable with coding in Javascript using the Jasmine BDD structure or, to be frank, using other BDD languages like Gherkin. So, with this user in mind, Fatalii is a framework that generates Jasmine tests from keyword and data-driven test scripts. It introduces a tabular keyword-driven scripting capability whilst keeping the benefits of Jasmine's BDD format and its integration with IDEs and CI tools. It's not magic - the program code behind each keyword still needs to be written in JavaScript by a developer. Fatalii helps with this by standardising the way in which the keyword code is written - how it is called, how it handles data passed to it, and how it can be reused and combined with other keywords.
